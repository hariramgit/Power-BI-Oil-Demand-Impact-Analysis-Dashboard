# Power-BI-Oil-Demand-Impact-Analysis-Dashboard

# Objective and Description of this Project:
This dashboard provides a comprehensive analysis of the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on global oil demand across different regions. The data is presented in a tabular format that highlights the changes in oil demand by geography and month, comparing current forecasts against pre-virus forecasts.

Key features:

**Geographical Breakdown**: The dashboard categorizes oil demand impact by major regions, including East Asia, Europe, North America, and Rest of the World (RoW), with further sub-regions listed under each major category. This allows for a detailed comparison of the pandemic’s impact across different areas.

**Monthly Analysis**: The impact on oil demand is tracked month-by-month, providing a timeline of how the COVID-19 outbreak has influenced oil consumption over time. The data spans from January to December, offering a full-year perspective.

**Data Visualization**: The use of color gradients (heatmap style) helps to visually represent the severity of the demand reduction in thousand barrels per day (bpd). Darker shades indicate a more significant decrease in oil demand, making it easier to identify trends and critical periods.

**Scenario Comparison**: The dashboard includes filters that allow users to compare different COVID-19 scenarios, such as "Effective Prevention" and "Mitigation." These scenarios reflect varying levels of social distancing and lockdown measures, offering insights into how different strategies have affected oil demand.

Interactive Elements: Filters for year and month enable users to adjust the view to specific time frames, enhancing the dashboard’s interactivity and usability for detailed analysis.

## Key Insights

**Severe Impact on Oil Demand**: The data reveals a significant reduction in oil demand across all regions, with the most substantial drops observed in North America and Europe, particularly during the early months of the pandemic.

**Regional Variations**: Different regions and sub-regions show varying levels of impact, reflecting differences in lockdown measures, economic activity, and other factors.

**Temporal Trends**: The timeline view helps identify critical periods where the demand impact was at its peak, aiding in understanding the pandemic's progression and its economic effects.
